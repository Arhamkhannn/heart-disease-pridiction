# Heart Disease Prediction (Machine Learning)

This project demonstrates a basic machine learning workflow
to predict heart disease using clinical data.

## Dataset
Heart Disease dataset containing medical attributes such as
age, cholesterol level, and heart rate.

## Models Used
- Logistic Regression (baseline)
- Decision Tree Classifier

## Key Concepts
- Train-test split
- Model comparison
- Overfitting vs generalization
- Accuracy-based evaluation

## Conclusion
While Decision Tree achieved higher accuracy, Logistic Regression
or a depth-limited tree provided more stable and generalizable
performance.
